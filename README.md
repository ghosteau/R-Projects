# R-Projects
These are generally some projects that I have done in R. Many of them are very basic, but others may be more complicated. I am constantly learning new things, so I may go back
and make changes at some points. 

On another side note, they are all R-markdown files that were knitted to be HTML files, but all of the code will be shown (besides loading in libraries or datasets in some cases).

I am going to do my best to upload the RMD files with them for easier access to the original code!
